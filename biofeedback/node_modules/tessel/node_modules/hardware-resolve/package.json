  "readme": "# hardware-resolve\n\nResolver for a `hardware` key in your `package.json`. Using this, you can can whitelist, blacklist, or substitute files from your directory when pushing to an embedded device.\n\nThis is similar to the \"browser\" field package.json spec: <https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901>\n\nFor example,\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": ...,\n  \"hardware\": {\n    \"grunt\": false,\n    \"./test\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis would prevent the \"grunt\" module from being pushed, as well as the nested folder \"test\" (with a leading './') and all files underneath it.\n\nBecause the \"hardware\" key whitelists all packages by default, you can switch to a \"blacklist\" mode simply by unincluding all modules/files first:\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": ...,\n  \"hardware\": {\n    \"*\": false,\n    \"./\": false,\n    \"async\": true,\n    \"./src\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis would *only* push the \"async\" module and the \"src\" directory.\n\nIn addition, you can alias files to other files.\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": ...,\n  \"hardware\": {\n    \"./index.js\": \"./hardware-shim/index.js\",\n    \"./hardware-shim\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis would replace the \"index.js\" root file with the \"hardware-shim/index.js\" file, but not include the \"hardware-shim\" directory in the upload.\n\n## license\n\nMIT\n",
